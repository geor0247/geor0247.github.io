        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an Indian by citizenship but I was born on the 6<sup>th</sup>of April 2004 in Kuwait and have been raised there. I am the eldest among three brothers in my family. I had completed my initial schooling from <abbr title="Carmel School, Kuwait">CSK</abbr> and I currently study at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design program. </p>
        <p>Because I am naturally inclined to things that involve a lot of imaginative thinking and creativity, choosing this program is, in my opinion a suitable fit. Making music, listening to film scores, jazz, rock, hip-hop or electronic music, watching Hollywood movies and reading spy thrillers are my favorite pastimes.</p>
